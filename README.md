Hello! This is a project that I made that involves the use of graphs to find the shortest path from one UNLV building to another. I was able to use hashmaps and even used a depth-first search function to
allow me to traverse the graph and find the shortest path.

Description: using stl objects, find the shortest path to the SU from the TBE while having atleast one stamina left.
This is supposed to make use of unordered maps, lists, and vectors in order to manipulate data to output whether or not
there is a path that exists within our graph that will take us from the starting node to the end node while still within bounds
of the assignment.
